            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Pablo is a penguin. A penguin who likes cars. And stealing. Stealing cars. He uses these stolen cars to
                transport certain types of goods wanted by certain types of people to certain places that the police,
                ahem, cops, may or may not necessarily approve of.</p>
            <p>You wanna work for Pablo? You gotta prove yourself. Strap in, hit that gas
                pedal, and get delivering!</p>

            <h2>Short Story</h2>
            <p>Pablo is much more than just a character in a videogame. Below you'll find a short story written by <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/stephiemillar">Stephanie Millar</a> about Pablo, his gang, and his car
                thieving ways. <a href="/crates/assets/short-story.png">Download the short story here!</p>

            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <center><img class="scale-with-grid" src="images/instructions.png"></center>

            <p>See this right here? This is your car. It's freshly stolen so be careful with it.</p>
            <center><img class="scale-with-grid" src="images/car.gif"></center>

            <p>If your car takes too much damage, your getaway is kaput and you're "busted."
                Don't get busted! Pablo doesn't let losers into his gang.</p>
            <center><img class="scale-with-grid" src="images/busted.png"></center>

            <p>Collect crates like this one:</p>
            <center><img class="scale-with-grid" src="images/crate.png"></center>

            <p>And deliver them to the drop points:</p>
            <center><img class="scale-with-grid" src="images/drop.png"></center>

            <p>This is a standard cop. They follow you like gnats and try to ram you. Don't let 'em.</p>
            <center><img class="scale-with-grid" src="images/cop.gif"></center>

            <p>This is a SWAT van. They follow you too, but a bit slower than cops. They can take more damage and
                sometimes drop spikes that slow you down if you run them over. ¡Cuidado!</p>
            <center><img class="scale-with-grid" src="images/swat.gif"><img class="scale-with-grid"
                                                                            src="images/spike.png"></center>

            <p>Get the highest score you can. If Pablo wants you in his gang, you'll know. You'll know.</p>
